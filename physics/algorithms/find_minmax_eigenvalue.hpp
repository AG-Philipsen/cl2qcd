         *        Rayleigh quotient estimate to get the largest eigenvalue of A). Hence to be sure
         *        that the algorithm works, the eigenvalues must be real. If this is not the case,
         *        the algorithm could give meaningless results or not converge. Actually, even if
         *        the eigenvalues are real, if there is not only ONE dominant eigenvalue, then
         *        the algorithm won't converge (for example if there are two opposite biggest eigenvalues).
         *        However, to be honest, in the RHMC with staggered fermions, one needs to find the
         *        maximum and the minimum eigenvalues of the matrix MdagM that is hermitian and then with
         *        real positive eigenvalue. For this reason, this function will calculate the eigenvalue
         *        if and only if the operator A is hermitian.
