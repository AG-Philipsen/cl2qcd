     * @todo get rid of this restriction.
     *
     * You might wonder why the transfer is split into multiple phases.
     * The major reason is that loading and dumping (aka. writing to the src and destination buffers) should usually
     * happen in the same command queue that is used by the kernels. Therefore you might first one all devices to dump
     * their local data into transfers and afterwards load the transfered data on each device to avoid serialization of
     * the transfers.
