 * the average will have a normal distribution with mean 4.
 * But the standard deviation of the mean is smaller than the standard
 * deviation of the individual samples by a factor of 1/√n, where n is the number of samples.
 * So in this example the average of our samples will have standard deviation 3/√10^6 = 0.003. An
 * important rule of thumb about normal distributions is that samples will lie within 2 standard
 * deviations of the mean about 95% of the time. This function calculates the mean of
