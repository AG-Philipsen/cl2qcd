\subsection{geometry.h geometry.cpp}
map from (x,y,z) basis to one int (nspace)

naming scheme: direction 1 = x; direction 2 = y; direction 3 = z; direction 0 = t

important: (x,y,z) are always used together and it should be possible to use a different number of space dimensions (defined in globals.h). t is always apart.
