\begin{abstract}
We want to write a complete HMC simulation programme with Wilson-type quarks (twisted mass action) using OpenCL for a hybrid structure consisting of CPUs and GPUs.

\section{General thoughts -- structure}
This will be a lot of work\ldots

So far, I've implemented the types for spinor, su3matrix and their fields on the lattice. The su3matrix so far is stored in matrix format, i.e. 18 doubles. That should be improved early on. The spinors are also full-spinors. However, I guess we should use half-spinor projections.

There are plaquette and Polyakov functions which work for a free gauge field. They should be tested against exisiting configs.

We could really need an interface to read xml-configs from the tmQCD code by Carsten (that way, we would also have ILDG format...)

There is now an interface to read xml-configs from the tmLQCD code. But up to now, the program has a different geometry than ILDG format has.
