In this section we describe the algorithm that is implemented in the programme. Ultimatively, we want to have an HMC with CG-solver (or maybe BiCGStab), even-odd preconditioning, leap-frog integration and possibly mass preconditioning {\bf references\_to\_be\_given\_by\_Lars}. That seems to be the standard choice of algorithm.

\subsection{Heatbath}
Right now only the heatbath algorithm is implemented. There is nothing fancy about it but it corresponds to the standard description given in {\bf reference\_to\_be\_given\_by\_Christopher}.
