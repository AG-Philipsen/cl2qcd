Provides class sourcefileparameters which reads in all information from a given tmlqcd file concerning gauge-configurations. Not fully implemented is the read-in of fermion-propagators. 

The reading-routine is based on a stand-alone-program that was written in C. The metainformations about the data are saved in XML- and XLF-format (see also appendix), while the actual data is saved binary. To read XLF and XLM files the LIME- (source) and XLM-libraries are used, which are only available for C. The routines are not optimized regarding speed or memory-usage since the reading of the data should only take place at the beginning of the programrun.

The reading of the metainforamtions was specifically tested for two tmlqcd-files created with different version of the hmc (5.1.1 and 5.1.5). Everything is read and saved into particular variables. If there are fermion-informations in the sourcefile, they are saved successively for each fermion. Here, only informations about the first are stored, all others are not read. This has not been implemented because there is most likely no need to read in propagators.

The binary data is saved into a field which is a parameter of the routine (as a pointer). The precision in which the data was saved is extracted before during the metainformation gain. ILDG is always stored big endian, so the routine checks the local endianness with htons() to get the right order of the bytes.
