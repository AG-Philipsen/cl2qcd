// Description of variables of global_squarenorm_reduction kernel:
//  - dest: The final result, namely the sum of the squarenorms of all staggered fields.
//  - result_tmp: This is the vector result filled by the kernel global_squarenorm_staggered.
//  - elems: It is the number of components of the vector result_tmp, namely the variable "num_groups"
//            of the kernel global_squarenorm_staggered.
