/** @file
 * Kernel for the eoprec staggered _@e partial fermion force.
 * @note Observe that the even-odd preconditioning does not directly affect
 *       the gaugemomenta since they are fields existing on the whole lattice as links.
 *       Here eoprec means that we calculate either the force on even sites or on odd ones.
 *       This kernel must then be called twice with different evenodd value to obtain the force
 *       on all sites.
 *
 * Here, two cases are possible: @n
 *  @arg evenodd = EVEN means that the force will be calculated on even sites  @n
 *  @arg evenodd =  ODD means that the force will be calculated on  odd sites  @n
 *
 * To make the code understandable, let us summarize the notation here. The force term here calculated
 * is not exactly the total fermion force (this explains the partial adjective), because of the rational
 * approximation. This kernel will be then used to reconstruct the whole force term (see fermion_force.cpp
 * file documentation in physics/algorithms to further informations).
 * In the RHMC the time derivative of the momenta conjugated to links is
 * @code
 *  i*Hdot_\mu(n)=[U_\mu(n)*\sum_{i=1}^k c_i Q^i_\mu(n)]_TA
 * @endcode
 * where
 * @code
 *               | +eta_\mu(n) (D_oe X_e^i)_{n+\mu} (X_e^i^\dag)_n     if evenodd = EVEN
 *  Q^i_\mu(n) = |
 *               | -eta_\mu(n) (X_e^i)_{n+\mu} ((D_oe X_e^i)^\dag)_n   if evenodd = ODD
 *
 * => this kernel will return -i*[U_\mu(n)*Q^i_\mu(n)]_TA
 * @endcode
 *
 * In this kernel only U_\mu(n)*Q^i_\mu(n) is evaluated and not the \sum. In the expression
 * above of Hdot_\mu(n) k is the order of rational approximation and c_i are the numerators.
 * Then for each i from 1 to k we will call this kernel twice. Finally, two different
 * spinorfield are passed to this kernel: A and B. Depending on evenodd they will be different
 * objects, but at this level it does not matter:
 * @code
 *               | +eta_\mu(n) (A)_{n+\mu} (B^\dag)_n     if evenodd = EVEN
 *  Q^i_\mu(n) = |
 *               | -eta_\mu(n) (A)_{n+\mu} (B^\dag)_n     if evenodd = ODD
 *
 * => return -i*[U_\mu(n)*Q^i_\mu(n)]_TA
 * @endcode
 *
 * If an imaginary chemical potential is introduced, the time derivative of the momenta conjugated to links
 * modifies due to a prefactor of the sum:
 * @code
 *  i*Hdot_\mu(n)=[U_\mu(n)* (1+\delta_{\mu,4}*(exp(\imath \mu_I)-1)) *\sum_{i=1}^k c_i Q^i_\mu(n)]_TA
 * @endcode
 * that basically means that we have to multiply Q^i_\mu(n) by exp(\imath \mu_I) if dir==TDIR before
 * taking the traceless_antihermitian_part. This is important because the factor is in general
 * not real. Then this kernel, if the imaginary chemical potential is used, returns
 * @code
 *  -i*[U_\mu(n)* (1+\delta_{\mu,4}*(exp(\imath \mu_I)-1)) *Q^i_\mu(n)]_TA
 * @endcode
 *
 * @note Without imaginary chemical potential, Q^i_\mu(n) is evaluated, then the product
 *       U_\mu(n)*Q^i_\mu(n) is calculated and in the end the traceless_antihermitian_part
 *       is taken. If chem_pot_im is different from zero, the multiplication by the factor
 *       (1+\delta_{\mu,4}*(exp(\imath \mu_I)-1)) is added just before the TA operation.
