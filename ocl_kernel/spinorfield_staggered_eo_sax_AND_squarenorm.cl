// This kernels performs the sax operation with a set of alpha constants and then
// it evaluates the squarenorm of each resulting field.

// Description of variables:
//  - x: The input staggered field (an su3vec per each site => vector of VOL4D/2
//       components that are su3vec varibles)
//  - alpha: vector of real numbers
//  - num_fields: number of constants alpha, i.e. number of output fields
//  - result: Vector of hmc_float that will contain the sums of the components of the result_local vectors.
//            Note that it has num_groups*num_fields components.
//  - result_local: Vector with local_size components. At the end of the local reduction, its first num_fields
//                  components will be the sum of all its components.
