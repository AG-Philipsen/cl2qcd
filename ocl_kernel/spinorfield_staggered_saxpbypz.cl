// Description of variables of saxsbypz:
//  - x: The first input staggered field (an su3vec per each site => vector of VOL4D
//       components that are su3vec varibles)
//  - y: The second input staggered field (an su3vec per each site => vector of VOL4D
//       components that are su3vec varibles)
//  - z: The third input staggered field (an su3vec per each site => vector of VOL4D
//       components that are su3vec varibles)
//  - alpha: The complex number by which x has to be multiplied
//  - beta:  The complex number by which y has to be multiplied
//  - out: The output staggered field: alpha*x+beta*y+z (site by site)
