# This defines the coding style to be used for OpTiMaL. You can automatically apply
# this coding style by running "astyle --options=astylerc <FILENAME>". Note that you
# can use the option -n to prevent creation of the backup file.
#
# Making sure you code confines to the coding style minimizes merge conflicts where
# only formatting changed.
