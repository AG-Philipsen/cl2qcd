CL2QCD
======

CL2QCD is a Lattice QCD application based on OpenCL, applicable to CPUs and GPUs.
It provides the possibility of producing gauge configurations using different algorithms as well as measuring observables on given configurations.

|     Executable     | Description |
| :----------------: | :---------: |
| `su3heatbath`      | Generation of gauge field configurations for SU(3) Pure Gauge Theory                  |
| `hmc`              | Generation of gauge field configurations for Nf=2 (Twisted Mass) Wilson type fermions |
| `rhmc`             | Generation of gauge field configurations for staggered type fermions                  |
| `inverter`         | Measurements of fermionic observables on given gauge field configurations             |
| `gaugeobservables` | Measurements of gauge observables on given gauge field configurations                 |

CL2QCD has been heavily optimized for AMD GPUs, providing world-class performance, but can also be used on NVIDIA GPUs and x86 CPUs.
