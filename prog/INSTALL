The hmc code uses CMake for build configuration and can in principle be build
via the usual steps:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake -i ..
make


Note that the build will not happen in the source directory. This is a desired
behaviour as it makes accidently adding build or execution results to the
version control system less likely.


The following libraries will be required:
OpenCL
LIME
libxml2


The build configuration uses some non-standard cmake scripts.

To find the OpenCL library a script calld FindOpenCL.cmake is used. You can
download the script from http://gitorious.org/findopencl. Make sure it can be
found by CMake. One option is to symlink it into some path searched for by
CMake, e.g.:

mkdir .cmake/modules
cd .cmake/modules
wget http://gitorious.org/findopencl/findopencl/blobs/raw/master/FindOpenCL.cmake

and adding the following to .bashrc:
alias cmake='cmake -DCMAKE_MODULE_PATH=~/.cmake/modules'

If you have the LIME-Library installed in some non-standard location you should
add it to your LIBRARY_PATH:
export LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/lime/lib

Note that that you of course also can simply inter the proper paths into CMake.
