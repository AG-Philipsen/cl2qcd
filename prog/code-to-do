host_operations_gaugefield: reduction: get rid of the ifs??
			  : extend: get rid of the ifs??
random.h: change seed for random numbers, perhaps dynamical??
types.h: local_work_size and global_work_size must be optimized for more than 1 dimension, this then also affects the reduction arrays when calculating the gaugeobservables
opencl_update_heatbath.cl:   perform update: perhaps one can define another acc-func here and save one copying step in the end??
			: save some operations at the projection??
			: replace operations with shorter ones and delete comments there
			: simplify calc_staple
take out PI because its already defined in cmath??
