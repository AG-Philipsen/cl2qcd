#
# Hook script to check the commit message.
#
# ENFORCED POLICY:
#  1) The first line of the commit must be at maximum 60 chars.
#     This is the hard limit for GitHub at which a commit message is hidden.
#     See https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/ for more infortmation.
#  2) The first line of the commit must have at least 8 chars.
#  3) The first line must begin with a character
#  4) A small letter at the beginning of the first line is capitalised
#  5) Any character among ".?!" at the end of the first line is removed
#     in a repetitive way (e.g. "commit..!!!" -> "commit")
#  6) The second line must be empty
#  7) Any following line after the second must be 72 chars at maximum
#  8) Trailing spaces at begin and end of the first two lines are removed
#
# Called by "git commit" with one argument, the name of the file
# that has the commit message.  The hook should exit with non-zero
# status after issuing an appropriate message if it wants to stop the
# commit. The hook is allowed to edit the commit message file.
#
# This hook has been taken from BaHaMAS and adapted to CL2QCD
# by Alessandro Sciarra <sciarra@th.physik.uni-frankfurt.de>
